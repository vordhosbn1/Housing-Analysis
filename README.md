# Housing-Analysis

Analysis and compares on-campus and off-campus housing options for students at **CSUMB**. Includes data collection, exploratory analysis, and a simple cost prediction model to help understand housing affordability and trends.



## Goals
- Compare cost trend across housing options **on-campus**:
*East Campus, North Quad, Promontory, Residence Halls*
- Compare **off-campus** listing via sources Zillow and Craigslist.
- Predict housing costs
- Visualize trends and help students make informed living decisions.



## Sources
- **On-Campus Housing**: CSUMB Housing website (https://csumb.edu/housing/)
- **Off-Campus Listings**: Public data from Zillow and/or Craigslist (manual collection or web scraping)



## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn 
-Streamlit (optional dashboard)

## Edge Cases/Disclaimer
- Missing fees such as utilities, parking, internet, pet deposits
- Variability in roomate situations (e.g., off-campus units may be shared, but listed as full
- Mandatory on-campus add-ons like **meal plans**, are sometimes excluded from total cost'
- Listings that lack sqft or misreport it
- Real-time availability, seasonal rent chances, or waitlist prio.

Project is not intended to precisely predict individual housing costs, but serve as a **demo tool** to help students, renters, or planners at CSUMB **understand the general trends** between on and off-campus housing.
